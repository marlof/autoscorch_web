<h2>📘 Case Study: From ANT to ScORCH</h2>
<h2>Simplifying Automation for Tax Infrastructure</h2>

<h2>🏢 Organization</h2>
<pre>
A technology partner supporting the Portuguese Tax Office,
responsible for maintaining and deploying critical systems
in a regulated, high-stakes environment.
</pre>

<h2>⚠️ The Challenge</h2>
<pre>
- Legacy ANT scripts powering build and deployment pipelines had become:
  • Verbose and difficult to maintain
  • Opaque to testers and non-developer stakeholders
  • Fragile under change, with poor auditability

- Operational teams struggled to understand or safely modify automation logic.
- Onboarding new contributors required deep XML knowledge and tribal context.
</pre>

<h2>🔄 The Migration</h2>
<pre>
- ScORCH was introduced as a lightweight, declarative alternative.
- Initial training focused on:
  • Plugin structure (SP_<SYSTEM>-<ACTION>())
  • Core verbs (Task, Manual, Message, Sleep)
  • Parameterization via GetVar

- ANT scripts were incrementally replaced with ScORCH plugins,
  each representing a discrete job or deployment step.
</pre>

<h2>✅ The Outcome</h2>
<pre>
- Clarity: ScORCH’s syntax was immediately understandable—even to testers.
- Modularity: Plugins could be reused, extended, and versioned independently.
- Auditability: Each job step was logged and traceable, supporting compliance.
- Empowerment: Teams could author and evolve automation without deep XML expertise.

<h2>💬 Quote from the Field</h2>
<div class="quote">
“Its brilliance is in its simplicity.”<br>
— Tester trained on ScORCH during the migration
</div>

<h2>🔧 Example Migration</h2>
<h3>Before (ANT fragment):</h3>
<pre>
&lt;target name="deploy"&gt;
  &lt;exec executable="scp"&gt;
    &lt;arg value="${build.artifact}" /&gt;
    &lt;arg value="user@host:/opt/app/" /&gt;
  &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</pre>

<h3>After (ScORCH plugin):</h3>
<pre>
SP_DEPLOY-ARTIFACT() {
  GetVar -pattern "Artifact" -name file_Artifact -default "/opt/app/build.jar"
  Task "scp ${file_Artifact} user@host:/opt/app/"
}
</pre>

<h2>📈 Lessons Learned</h2>
<pre>
- ScORCH is not just a tool—it’s a language for automation.
- Declarative plugins reduce onboarding time and increase operational confidence.
- Even in regulated environments, simplicity can be a strategic advantage.
